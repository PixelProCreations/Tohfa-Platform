/**
 * Generated from the _example reference module. See CLAUDE.md.
 *
 * <name>.service.ts holds the business logic and is the ONLY layer that makes
 * authorization decisions beyond "does the actor hold this permission".
 * Rules:
 *  - Take the `ResolvedScope` produced by `requirePermission`, never a Request.
 *    That keeps the service callable from a job, a script or a test.
 *  - Throw `AppError` with a domain `ErrorCode`; never return an error shape.
 *
 * There is no `scopedWhere` here on purpose. This endpoint has exactly one
 * addressable row — the caller's own farm — so the scope is not translated
 * into a WHERE fragment; it IS the lookup key. `scope.farmerId` is the only
 * identity this service will accept, which is what makes a farmer physically
 * unable to ask for another farmer's coordinates: there is no parameter to
 * put one in.
