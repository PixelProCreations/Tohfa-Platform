# TOHFA Platform

Monorepo for TOHFA — the Nilgiris farmer-to-customer produce platform: farmer
onboarding and certification, produce listings with a fair-price ceiling and
counter-offers, warehouse operations across Ooty / Coonoor / Kotagiri / Gudalur,
customer ordering, wallets and farmer payouts.

## Prerequisites

- Node 20.11+ (see `engines`)
- pnpm 9 (`corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@9 --activate`)
- Docker + Docker Compose: **required for Redis** (the `redis` service in
  `docker-compose.yml`; `pnpm dev` starts it). Docker is **optional for
  Postgres** when `DATABASE_URL` points at the shared Dev database.
- A PostgreSQL 16 database with the PostGIS, pgcrypto and btree_gist
  extensions, reachable through `DATABASE_URL`: either the shared Dev database
  (Supabase) or the local container from `pnpm infra:up`.

## Quick start

### A. Shared Dev database (Supabase)

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # then set DATABASE_URL (+ DATABASE_SSL) to the shared Dev values
pnpm i
pnpm dev               # starts the Redis container, then API on :3000 and admin web on :4200
```

Do **not** run `db:migrate`, `db:rollback`, `db:reset` or `db:seed` against the
shared database from a feature branch: only code merged into Dev migrates it.
See [`docs/dev-database.md`](docs/dev-database.md).

### B. Fully local (Docker Postgres + Redis)

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # defaults already point at the local containers
pnpm i
pnpm infra:up          # docker compose up -d --wait postgres redis
pnpm db:reset          # rollback --all + migrate + seed (reference data + permissions)
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm infra:down` stops the containers (data volumes are kept).

`pnpm db:seed` loads reference data and permissions only (`db/seed/001`,
`002`). There are currently no seeded users: the old dev-user/demo seeds are
retired and a fresh seed will be written. Tests that log in as seeded admins
need those users (see `docs/dev-database.md`).

Redis: the app expects `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379`. The compose Redis
runs with append-only persistence; BullMQ also wants
`maxmemory-policy noeviction`, which the compose file does not set (see
`docs/dev-database.md`).

Other entry points: `pnpm dev:worker` (BullMQ worker), `pnpm test`,
`pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm spec:lint`, `pnpm rbac:check`.
Tests commit rows: run them only against a throwaway database, never the shared
one.

## Folder map

```
apps/
  api/              Express 4 + TypeScript REST API. The reference codebase.
    src/modules/_example/   COPY THIS for every new module.
    src/rbac/               Permission resolution — read before touching auth.
  admin-web/        Angular 17 standalone admin console.
  mobile/           React Native 0.74, single app for farmer/customer/admin roles.
packages/
  shared-types/     Enums, ErrorCode union, Problem, Money. No runtime deps.
  design-tokens/    Brand colours, type scale, spacing. Single source of truth.
db/
  migrations/       Numbered .sql files, applied in order by `pnpm db:migrate`.
  seed/             Reference data + permissions (001, 002).
docs/
  openapi.yaml      API contract. Lint with `pnpm spec:lint`.
  rbac.json         Authorization ground truth. Loaded at runtime by the API.
  rules.md          Business rules (fair price, counter-offers, allocation...).
scripts/
  check-rbac-drift.ts   Fails CI when the DB disagrees with docs/rbac.json.
  new-module.ts         Scaffolds a module from the _example pattern.
```

## Rules of the road

- `docs/rbac.json` is authoritative. Never hard-code a role check in a handler;
  use `requirePermission('some.permission.code')` and the `req.scope` it sets.
- Money is never a float. Use the `Money` helpers in `@tohfa/shared-types`.
- Errors are RFC 9457 problem+json with a stable `code` from the `ErrorCode`
  union — clients switch on `code`, never on message text.
- Every new API module copies `apps/api/src/modules/_example/` verbatim, then
  renames. `pnpm new:module <name>` does that for you.

## Further reading

- `docs/` — OpenAPI contract, RBAC matrix, business rules.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `apps/*/CLAUDE.md` — the conventions every contributor (human or
  agent) must follow when adding to this repo.
- `docs/dev-database.md` — how the shared Dev database is used and who may migrate it.
