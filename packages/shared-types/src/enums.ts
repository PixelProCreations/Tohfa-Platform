/**
 * Domain enumerations.

 * Pattern: a frozen `as const` object plus a derived union type. This gives us

 * time union — without TypeScript's `enum`, which does not survive
 * `isolatedModules` cleanly and produces surprising runtime objects.
 *
 * Every string value here MUST match the corresponding CHECK constraint or
 * enum type in db/migrations. `pnpm rbac:check` covers roles; the rest are
